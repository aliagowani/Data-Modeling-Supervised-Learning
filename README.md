# Data Moderling for Supervised Learning 

This course introduces traditional statistics and data modeling for supervised learning problems, as employed in observational and experimental research. With supervised learning there is a clear distinction between explanatory and response variables. The objective is to predict responses, whether they be quantitative as with multiple regression, or categorical as with logistic regression and multinomial logit models. Students work on research and programming assignments, exploring data, identifying appropriate models, and validating models. They utilize techniques for observational and experimental research design, data visualization, variable transformation, model diagnostics, and model selection.

**Objectives:**
- Applied the three-step process of statistical modeling consisting of: (1) exploratory data analysis, (2) model identification, and (3) model validation.
- Used conceptual and theoretical foundations of Linear Regression and the General Linear Model justify choices and actions in the data modeling process and in the interpretation of results.
- Compared and contrasted the conceptual and practical differences between statistical inference and predictive modeling.
- Created programs and code using the R statistical computing framework for data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and for fitting and validating statistical models.
- Modeled non-linear relationships between variables using transformations, higher-order linear models, and models with interaction.
- Used automated variable selection procedures as a tool for model identification in the presence of a large number of predictor variables, in addition to articulating procedure strengths and limitations.
